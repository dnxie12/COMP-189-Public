# Lecture 5 - More on Representing Information

## Transmitting Data Continued
* The class started with a revision on binary/other number system representations
* Note that on the most basic level - computers do not understand characters 
    * This is why ASCII is needed

### Bits and Bytes
* A byte represents 8 bits
    * Usually computers move around bytes (not bits)
* A word is 16 bits
* We use the prefixes kilo, mega, giga, tera to represent large number of bits/bytes
* Packets usually carry around 700 bytes

### Exercise
* Say we have a picture of 370 (wide) by 247 (height) pixels encoded in 8-bit color - how much storage space will the picture require?
    * Note that we have 370 * 247 pixels
    * Each color would require 24 bits, height would be 16 bits, width would be 16 bits
    * The image is going to take 16 * 2 + 24 * (370 * 247) = 2193392 bits
* Assuming a packet carries a 1kB payload, how many pickets would be required to transmit the picture?
    * We first divide 2193392 bits by 8 to give 274 174 bytes
    * Since each packet carries 1kB, we need 268 (275?) packets to carry the whole picture
* Note that colors are nowadays represented by more than 8 bits (more option)

## Representing Styles/More than Text
* When we are experiencing the internet, we are most often experiencing **stylized** text
    * Lists, bold, italics, etc.
    * A lot of the style on the internet is however encoded as text - bold text is still text and can be selected
        * We want to change specific attributes of particular parts of the text
    * This leads to the introduction of tags
        * In HTML, we have bold tags, italics tags, etc.
        * The bold font is rendered by web browser/word
* Tags introduce a problem for web browsers: It becomes hard to print the actual symbols used for tags
    * Most particularly, the character `<`
    * We need to use escape characters if we want to write some tag characters
