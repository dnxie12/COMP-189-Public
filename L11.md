# Lecture 11 - Internet Routing Continued

* The endpoints of routing is usually servers and not routers
* The IXP is technically just one big router
    * Across cities, the cables of an ISP are used in order to reach the destination IXP
    * The IXPs are not connecteed to each other but are used to transfer packets from one ISP's network to another ISP's network
* The only difference betweene a modem and a router 
    * A modem is an interface between our personal network and an ISP
    * A router makes decisions about how/where to route packets
* For exam: 
    1. Be able to produce small scale IXP/Router/ISP diagram

## Network Analysis
* The number of machines we pass through affects the time that a packet takes to reach its destination
    * There are 3 tools we can use to follow our packets

### Ping
* Tries to reach a remote server
* Need to use command prompt/terminal
* `ping www.google.com`
    * `ping` is a keyword that refers to the concept of radars/sonars
* The time described by ping is a roundtrip time
* The reason why some of the pings take longer could be because of path searching?

### Traceroute
* Tell every router along the way of a routing to return their identity
* Does not always work
    * Some routers may deliberately not want to respond to a traceroute command for security reasons
        * Prevent DDoS, danger of sharing IP address
