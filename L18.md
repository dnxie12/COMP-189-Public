# Lecture 18 - Network Neutrality

* There are 3 things that ISP do not like
    1. Video Streaming
        * Constant stream of packets as opposed to more static things such as browsing the web
    2. VoIP 
        * Problem because the ISP has to handle 2+ way in/out traffic
    3. P2P file sharing
        * Moves away from a centralized client-server interface
        * Found in services such as BitTorrent
        * Idea of contacting other computers instead of servers to obtain information
        * Generates a huge amount of traffic
            * ISPs' network is optimized assuming users are consumers of data (i.e. consuming from a server)
            * Networks are not as optimized for upload (and therefore P2P-type services)
* ISPs do not like the above because they generate a huge amount of data
    * We are not even interacting with most of the content we are streaming
    * ISPs are worried about this traffic because they have limited bandwith/connectivity
* ISPs also do not like the technologies above because
    * When Netflix came to Canada, Rogers lowered their bandwith caps 
    * Main reason: Rogers offers a streaming service and was afraid that Netflix turn people away from the former
        * Give an edge to their own in-house product
    * In the case above, Rogers was in a situation where they both provide internet *and* directly compete with specific internet services
        * In such cases, companies may be incentivized to not act in the best interest of consumers' internet services
    * Similar situation years ago when Comcast was blocking packets to/from Limewire
        * Comcast's reason was to optimize performance
    * Verizon got in trouble when they started degrading the performance of starcraft
* Net neutrality is the position that all packets/content on the Internet are created equal and should be treated with equal priority

## Traffic Shaping
* Technology that enables net neutrality
* Traffic shaping is the idea of being able to tell router what to prioritize 
    * Give different quantities of the bandwith to different contents (Web vs VoIP, etc.) according to their priority
* Traffic can be recognized using port number on a specific packet
    * For example, port 80 refers to web content
* An ISP has 2 choices:
    1. Treat all packets as equal
    2. Prioritize some traffic (content not treated equally)
        * ISPs might want to opt for this option in order to optimize speed and experience
            * In a stream, the difference between 10 ms delay and 100 ms delay is huge
            * When loading a website, such as difference does not matter as much
        * ISPs might want to restrict content to some services such as Netflix because it prefers delivering its own competing product

## Paid Priority Service
* Currently, requesting content from Google or Facebook is done at the same speed without paying extra
* Companies could want to charge a *premium* to some websites in order to deliver their packets faster to users (prioritize them)
    * Leads to a significant amount of revenue
* Without net neutrality, some smaller websites that cannot afford such premium fees may get outclassed

## Takeaway
* Neutrality as an absolute idea is a terrible idea
    * From a service perspective, ISPs would not be able to prioritize services that *require* fast/large amounts of bandwith such as video streaming
* Allowing users to choose their own traffic shape can be problematic because traffic shaping relies on every router to follow the same shape
    * Allowing users to choose their own shape would inevitably lead to confusion/collision down the traffic line as users would inevitably want to prioritise different services
* Often there is a disconnect between what legislators think and how technology actually works
