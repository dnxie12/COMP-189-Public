# Lecture 6 - Basic HTML

## Tags and Syntax
* Returns/Enter are not interpreted by a web browser
    * This means that we could technically a whole webpage in 1 line
* HTML relies on the use of **explicit** tags to style/change text 
* Nested tags are important and should be used
    * For example, we use nested tags in ordered lists in order to provide an order

## Attributes
* Some tags like for font have other attributes inside
    * Whatever we do not want to change, we leave out (attributes are not all required)
* We can include hyperlinks using `<a href='www.link.com'></a>`
    * `a` means address (also used for images)
* When an attribute is blank, the target word is displayed as blank

## Tables
* THe most sophisticated structure built in a web page 
```HTML
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>...</th>
        <th>...</th>
</table>
```

## Markup Languages
* All word processors are applying markups behind the scenes
    * When Word goes wrong, it is because it is trying to insert tags in non-intended places
    * Word is WYSIWYT 
        * Problem wiht those editors: need to interpret buttons into tags - can cause problems
* Software such as MS Word works with tags internally
* XML fixes a flaw of HTML?
