# Lecture 7 - Getting Connected to the Internet

* We will focus on *how* we are connected to the internet
* We will use these ideas to discuss about:
    * Which of the restrictions on our usage are technical vs which restrictions are due to company greed?
    * Are free WiFi zones a good idea?
    * Who controls how information moves around?
        * Are there people intercepting our packets to say Facebook?

## Ways to Connect to the Internet
* Most common:
    * Dial-Up
    * Ethernet
        * The simplest way of networking 
        * Computers sending over ethernet: repeatedly tapping wire with electricity/no electricity to send information
        * Simplest way of doing it because it translates exactly what the computer is doing (0s and 1s)
        * On an ethernet network, anybody on the wire can see it 
        * When multiple computers send at the same time, it causes a problem
            * Usually we solve by having computers take turns transmitting (one of them eventually goes first)
            * If 2 computers transmit at the same time (collision), they do something **exponential backoff**
                * Each computer generates a random amunt of time to wait before transmitting
        * Usually on an ethernet network, one of the computers (the gateway) has a connection to the internet
            * Before: we used to manually input the address of the gateway
            * The gateway takes any packet sent out, and will forward the packets that it sees are not for computers on the network
        * Note that all computers could access packets being sent
            * Usually, computers see that a packet is not directed toward them and will ignore it
        * The **collision domain** is the number of computers on a certain wire
            * An ethernet bridge separates collision domains and make them smaller
            * Bridge will pass packets from one domain the another domain only when relevant
    * Most common: WiFi
        * Wireless Fidelity
        * Creates collision domains in similar way
        * Usually access points are connected to ethernet 
        * Since there are different frequencies, collision is rarer
        * A similar exponential backoff is used to deal with collisions
    * Cable (internet delivery)
        * Original idea: cable television was already wired into homes
            * Original difference with landline: with cable we are only delivering information whereas with landlines we had to send back information
        * The cable setup was analogous to an ethernet setup
            * The ethernet protocol is based on the cables that already dropped into people's hmes
        * Our speed depends on how many people in our neighbourhood are using the internet
            * Cable cannot guarantee the speed we get because how our neighbours behave has an influence on our speed
    * DSL (internet delivery)
        * Built on the original idea that phone/landlines were already wired into homes
        * Wire running straight/directly from home to ISP server
        * Ends up being more expensive????
* The general idea
    1. An ISP is connected to the internet and provides connection to itself to customers
* Modem vs Router
    * A modem's original job is to convert digital 1s and 0s into analog (sound waves)
    * Now a modem's job is to be our local connection to the internet
        * Where we interact with the ISP
    * A lot of modems come with wi-fi capabilities built into them
    * Technically a router is what is used to transmit wifi and to decide where packets go
