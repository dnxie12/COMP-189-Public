# Lecture 1 - Context + Logistics

## 3 Principles of Technology
1. Technology Makes Rules
    * Rules are often created around the limitations of technology
        * Think removing shoes at airport checks - because the scanning machine cannot properly scan shoes
2. Technology Enforces Rules
    * The password is a dominant mechanism for accessing things using computers
3. Technology Changes Us
    * Air conditioners is a profound example of this
        * They are credited with dissolving neighbourhood as the central unit of social interaction
        * When it is really hot and there is no AC, people tend to not sit inside their house house
            * People would be outside, interacting with others
        * With AC, we can now simply stay home on hot days
            * This leads to less interactions
    * Bluetooth Headsets
    * iPads, touch devices
        * Change the way we interact with everyday objects
