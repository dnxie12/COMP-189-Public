# Lecture 15 - NAT Extended

* NAT is done in more than in a LAN

## SuperBowl Example
* Usually, to watch the Super Bowl in Canada, we pay cable to watch it
* In the US, the game is streamed for *free* on Fox's network
    * We cannot use this method in Canada because the content is geo-fenced to the US
    * The website can tell we are not in the US because:
        1. Our IP address is located within Canada
    * We solve this problem using a VPN

## VPN
* Virtual Private Network
* VPNs allow us to hide our IP address as an American one
    * We use NAT technology to route through a computer that switches our packet
    * Our packet will have official destination set to the VPN server, but will also contain actual destination (i.e. FOX Server) inside the packet's data
    * The VPN will do NAT to know where to send the packets back to 
    * The VPN is a "middle-man" for us
* Side: Fox does not want to restrict geolocation very strictly because more views = more money
* To figure out if someone's using a VPN
    * Check if a lot of requests are from the same IP (and that address is from a known VPN company) then potentially ban that IP
    * Built-in computer GPS/Location if we allow web browser to access it
    * The website could grab the GPS location from our computer
* The McGill VPN allows us to access the e-content inside the McGill Library even when we are not using McGill Wifi
* Good uses of VPN
    * Privacy
* Careful with using VPN: 
    * When stumbling upon honeypot through a VPN that keeps logs, the owner of the honeypot could force VPN to give identities of traffic

## IPv4
* Since NAT is a good way to "re-use" public addresses, IoT is not actually the main reason behind running out of IPv4 addresses
* The main reason why IPv4 addresses are running out is because of the rise of developing countries and their use of internet
