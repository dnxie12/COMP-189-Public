# Lecture 10 - Internet Routing/IP Continued

## A Hierarchy of Networks
* The internet is really just a hierarchy of networks
* At a lower/local level we have a **LAN** (local area network)
    * Traffic is not goint out
    * See McGill's own network
    * If we are strictly using LAN, there is technically no need to pay for internet through an ISP
    * See how AirDrop or LAN parties work
    * LAN is a smaller **intranet**
* The ISP also runs a network
    * All of the ISP's customers' traffic goes through the same network
    * Called **PoP** (Point of Presence)
    * We first get through all the ISP infrastructure before reaching the internet cloud
* The **IXP** stands for Internet Exchange Point
    * Where the ISP's infrastructure "hits" the cloud 
    * Kind of the central point where traffic can change from network to network
        * e.g. from Videotron's network to McGill's network
    * Notice how there no cloud involved when only transiting through IXP
    * Usually big companie + ISP have a direct connection to the IXP
    * Being on the IXP is very expensive + very heavy set-up
    * The IXP routes based on IP Address
    * We pay ISP to have access to IXP in order to reach other people
* Originally, the internet had a backbone
* The "cloud" is just an abstraction for the routing/networks that form the internet
    * The internet is an agglomeration of entities with all kinds of different motives that agreed to interconnet to pass information around
    * Everything is a gateway/there are layers of gateway
