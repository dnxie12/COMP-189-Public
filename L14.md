# Lecture 14 - NATs

* When sending packets, there are 4 translations that occur
    * Inside LAN -> Outside LAN -> Outside LAN -> Inside LAN
* We talked about using ports to specify which computer inside the LAN a server wants to target
    * For programs inside computers, we already had the solution: using ports
    * When sending out, we write IP:port
        * Usually: destination is port 80 (http), port for mail is 25, talking to a computer is port 21
        * Our computer's source port is assigned when say a tab is opened

## NAT Tables
* When the router sends a packet, it keeps a table of the mapping between inside and outside ports
    * Our internal port may be say 127 and the outside port is say 438
    * Google will respond to port 438
    * Our router translates pack to our internal port (438 -> 127)
    * Note that the source address inside the LAN when receiving a packet is not the router - it is for the original destination (e.g. Google)
* This works with an infinite number of LANs inside each other
* Part of the NAT process is so that computers do not realize they have been natted
* Biggest value of a port: 16 bits
    * If we "run out" of ports people will start getting kicked off the connection
