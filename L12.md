# Lecture 12 - Ownership on the Internet

## ICANN
* In charge of regulating IPv4, IPv6, and Top-Level domain name space

## IPv4
* Before the rising popularity of internet and IoT devices, IPv4 address space was thought to be gigantic and more than enough
* The address space of IPv4 is 256 ^ 4 which can represent about 4 billion devices
    * In the western world currently, each person accounts for about 8 devices
    * We ran out of IPv4 addresses in 2010 but not because of all the smart devices (although the latter seemed likely)
    * We will consider the question: if every computer needs an IP Address, why does everyone in a small area (say roommate, dormmate, etc.) often have the same IP address?
* Restrictions on IPv4
    * Say we are Videotron and have a bunch of houses connected up (each with a modem)
        * As Videotron, we can give each modem an IP address (public address)
        * It is not sustainable however to produce a new IP address for *every* new device
        * Solution: have a modem stand in for the computetrs connecting to it (as a sort of gateway)
            * This goes back to the internet being networks of networks
            * The modem creates a smaller network and starts handing IP addresses (private IP address) on its own without worrying about the outside world
                * This is not a problem because all computers on the network *must* connect through the modem
        * The network performs network address translation
