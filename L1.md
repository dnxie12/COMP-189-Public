# Lecture 1 - Internet ("Why does my webpage take a long time to load?")

* Who should we blame when things like this happen?
* What are network bottlenecks?
* Answers to these questions show us why and how the internet was designed back then

## The Web 
* We typically think of **link connectivity**
    * Click on something and be teleported to somewhere else
    * Virtually unchanged from when it was developed in 1970
    * Idea: a piece of content references another piece of content
    * Almost all the time the content is not on our computer, link connectivity eliminates/masks the location of the content
        * Allows us to go from pulling content from the UK to content from San Francisco
* We will focus on **physical connectivity**
    * We only experience a small portion of it
    * We are talking about the physical connectivity linking computers that allows us to actually get information
    * Very complex system of connections
    * Basically anything that moves information from one place to another place
    * Wi-fi is physical connectivity

### Potential Bottlenecks
* A server is fundamentally a computer 
    * Its job is different: our laptop is a user inferface device while a server's 1 purpose is to *serve* content
        * Hand web pages out
        * Send video stream out
    * Most servers are huge
* Since there are no physical cables that run from our computer to the main server, we have to go through a series of hops across devices
    * We first go to router, then ISP server, then a local server, etc.
    * The final destination sends the information back (not necessarily the same path)
    * Any high speed is also certainly wired
* Any place a connection occurs can be a potential bottleneck
    * When there is too much data being moved across the connection at once (bandwidth overload) there could be bottlenecks
    * 2 possibilities of slowdowns:
        1. Things interfering with wireless connection
        2. Too many people using router
            * Too much being asked from our router/too many requests (bandwidth overload)

### Bandwidth
* The fundamental way computers represent information is through **bits**
    * It is the "alphabet" for computers
    * bandwidth is how quickly information can be sent and is measured in bits per second (bps)
        * bandwidth is the **maximum** amount of information that can be sent
        * In English we can think of as character per second
* Things that impact speed
    1. Computers are mismatched 
        * Kind of like talking to a child - need to repeat stuff often
        * Occurs in cases where a computer involved in the transaction cannot translate information quickly enough
    2. Connection quality goes down
        * Could make bitrate drop
        * On a wireless connections, there could be interference from cellphones
* Measuring information
    * A router that receives a connection of 10 Mpbs (max bandwidth) could need to split among 4 computers
        * This affects our download speed - some computers will receive less bandwidth
    * Slowdowns can occur along the chain
        * Most notably, at the source of the webpage (Google's server)
        * Server could slow down because of too many users (too many requests for the server)
        * Server could slow down because of bandwidth constraints
    * Slow down because we lost a server along the path
        * If a server breaks down
        * When the Internet was designed, the military was concerned because it did not want a well-targeted attack to make all communications go down
            * This led them to design a decentralized internet
                * Somebody could get screwed over but the whole world will not get screwed over
                * There could be slow downs, but information still travels
            * There are many paths through the internet
        * If something happens to a server as it is handling our request, our request wll be officially gone
            * Could be a reason why we need to refresh our page

### Packets
* What do we mean when we say that a request is sent?
    * The fundamental idea is that of packets
        * Taking content of say a webpage (text, image, etc.) and send each piece by chopping up into small information pieces
        * The small pieces are packed into envelopes called packets that are then sent
        * Every packet contains a certain number of bits
    * Thought experiment
        * It is technically possible to send a Boeing 747 through the mail by:  
            1. Making sure the person on the other side has the instructions to rebuild the plane from small pieces
            2. Chopping up the whole plane into little pieces that are mailable
        * The good thing is that bits are conveniently choppable and re-assemblable
