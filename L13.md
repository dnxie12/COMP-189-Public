# Lecture 13 - IP Addresses Continued

* We continue discussing the idea of public and private IP
* When our computer sends a packet, the origin is our private IP
    * Our router changes that packet and sets the origin to its own public IP
* The same process occurs when receiving a response from Google (our router sets the new destination to our private IP)
* When we change IP address say during a video call, we experience a small buffer which represents our computer recontacting the server from our new IP address
    * But after a request was made from address A, the server will respond to address A
* How does a router to which local computer to adapt the origin of the packet to?
    * 1 Solution: our router has memory to store the outbound packets and uses that to match the incoming packets
    * Our solution: write name of specific computer and public IP on packet
    * This problem even applies on the tab level: what if we have 2 youtube tabs pulling information at the same time?
        * The solution is the same: adding a numerical identifier at the end of IP addresses (what we call **ports**)
        * By convention, webservers are assigned **port 80**
