# Lecture 3 - Transmitting Information Continued

This lecture was given virtually

## Packet Creation
* We want the following characteristics for any piece of information we are sending
    1. Can be manipulated by a computer
    2. Is easily divisible/split up
    3. Is content agnostic
        * We do not want to re-invent transmission for every type of file
* One of the main challenges is splitting things that may be hard to split - images, movies, music, powerpoint presentations, etc.

## Binary Representation
1. Representing numbers
    * Think about our decimal system and make a parallel
    * The "characters" in decimal are assigned a meaning, but do not have an inherent meaning
    * We are used to counting in base 10, i.e. using the characters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    * In binary, we only have 2 symbols - 0 and 1
2. Build things out of numbers
    * We are essentially trying to build things out of numbers
3. Representing Images in Binary
    * Computers transform images into a grid and fill pixel by pixel
    * For black/white images, we can set 0 = white and 1 = black
    * We often store image information in long sequences of bits
        * We could to add a width and a height indicator at the front of the sequence (in binary) 
        * We could decide to add 4 bits for width and 4 bits for height
        * The decisions above represent the guideline of a particular **format** (in our case a **bitmap**)
4. Formats
    * A format represents the arrangement of bits used to represent the information in a file
    * There are multiple different formats
        * See `.txt`, `.doc`, `pages`
        * We have different names for the file formats because they hold our files in different formats
