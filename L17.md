# Lecture 17 - Domain Names

* Usually when reading a domain say `www.google.com` we do so from right to left
    * **Top-level** domain: `.ca, .com`, etc.
    * `google` is a **sub-domain** of `.com`
    * `www` is a **sub-domain** of `google.com`
* When talking about URL we also include the sub-directories behind a domain
* The route consists strictly of the directory path after a top-level domain
* Top-Level Domains (TLD) are often bound to countries
    * To buy a `.ca` one needs to be a Canadian citizen
* Even though ICANN supervises the domains, it is not the one that operates a single DNS server 
    * Disadvantage of ICANN having one giant server: hard to manage all possible request, latency problems, etc.
    * ICANN instead has a hierarchy of DNS servers
        * Root knows which sub-server can resolve questions about different domains (.com, .ca, etc.)
        * The sub-servers know about the sub-sub-servers which can resolve sub-domain names
        * Those DNS sesrvers are **name servers**
    * Our computer comes with the DNS servers stored 
* Because of decentralization, ICANN does not run all DNS
    * For example, McGill' DNS is run by McGill 
        * These servers are not authorized (not truly trusted)
    * This leads to 2 dangers:
        * Smaller firms usually have less resources to run such servers
        * Usually, "local" DNS servers set themselves as default server in our computers
            * This is done for the purpose of DNS caching - remembering addresses that are frequently used
            * This can however be dangerous when done at a public place such as a cafe: a hacker could take over a DNS and redirect to rogue websites
                * Since our computer always connects to the strongest signal, we could unknowingly connect to a rogue router that pretends to be something else
            * You can block certain addresses that way
            * Usually when our local DNS needs help, we will be redirected to ICANN

## DNS Attacks

### Rogue DNS
* A rogue DNS could mislead us into going to phishing websites when we try to access legitimate websites

### DNS Poisoning
* When we hack a domain name server and fool it into providing a rogue IP address when users make a legitimate request

## Domain Name Purchasing
* Some domains have gone for millions
* Domains such as `toys.com`, `beer.com`, etc.
* People regularly buy domains in anticipation of product launches
    * This is a way of owning internet real estate
