# Lecture 4 - Encoding

## Images in Binary
* Color is now in the picture - many different colors
* Images consist of pixels
    * Every pixel can be described by some combination of RGB
        * The colors are combined in different ways to form all possible colors
    * We need 3 values to describe each pixel (a value for each color)
        * We need to express the intensity of each color (commonly through an integere for each color)
            * Usually, the number of values used is **256**
            * So a completely bright red pixel would be described as (255, 0, 0)
        * The reason why we chose 256 as number of values is because of binary representation
            * It takes us 8 bits to write any value in the range 0-255
* Each color needs 8 bits 
    * This means that to express 3 colors we need 24 bits
* To represent an image, the total size consists of the sum of the size of each pixel + the size for width and height (usually 8 bits each)
    * A whole image is represented by a sequence of bits
    * The fact that images can be split into bits allows us to chop them into pieces and move them across the internet

## Words in Binary
* There is a way to turn words into a binary sequence through the ASCII encoding standard
    * Every "symbol" is given a number
    * There are 256 possible values since ASCII is 8-bit
* Computers think in binary
    * This is why numbers such as 32, 64 are important
    * The numbers represent the "turning" of a digit

## Recap
* Recall how we want an encoding system that is:
    1. Computer Friendly
    2. Can be subdivided
    3. Is content agnostic
* Bits/binary representations give us this option
    * Numbers
    * Images
    * Text
