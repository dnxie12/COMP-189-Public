# Lecture 2 - Internet and Information Part 2

## Sending Information
* Most content received on internet can be conceived as a file
* Idea: each file is chopped into bits then sent
    * Our computer is grabbing a sequence of packages and then re-assembling
* A disadvantage of sending a whole file at once:
    * File could be very large - ties up the internet
    * If sending something as a whole and that thing gets corrupted, it is much easier to re-send smaller things than the whole thing (i.e. error correction)

### Packet Routing
* Packets act as somee sort of virtual envelopes
* Because packets have a from/to address, the idea of making the internet completely anonymous is not easily achievable
* If along routing we lost a packet, our computer, when assembling the packets (they are numbered), can tell that we are missing something
    * Our systems have a configurable timer for how long they should wait for missing packets
    * When the timer goes off, our computer will go and obtain the rest of the information (only the missing information)
    * When all the packets are received, our computer will re-order them and stitch them into the final file which is handed over to our web browser
    * Duplicates are thrown out
* Remember that webpages are a collection of things - some sort of canvas
    * All text, image, video come together to make the webpage
    * Our webpage can "auto-populate" as things are arriving
* Nowadays, everything more sophisticated than a TV Remote is almost certainly using packets

### TCP vs UDP Routing
* Some things would not be possible if we always need to wait for every packet to arrive - things such as **streaming**
    * See Youtube, Netflix, etc.
* **TCP** guarantees that we obtained all our packets
    * Guarantees order, completeness
    * What we talked about earlier ("traditional" packet routing)
* For streaming, we just want something that gives content - **UDP**
    * Does not guarantee order, full delivery
        * This means that there are dropped packets on streams: the cause of gargled audio/seeing someone but not hearing them, vice-versa/buffering/interpolation/loss of quality (Youtube)
    * Used for streams
* The 2 protocols can and will get mixed

## Chopping Information
* How are we chopping information up? How are we sending information through the internet?
* Idea: We want to chop stuff into pieces that are easier to send repeatedly
    * Text chops off really nicely (e.g. sending the first 15 characters, then the next 15, etc.)
    * For other things such as movies, audio, etc. it is a bit harder
* Note that we are not coming up with a special way of sending each kind of information
    * Sending something like a 3D model file is not different/special
    * The preferred way is an information representation that:
        1. Can be manipulated by a computer
        2. Is easily divisible
        3. Is content agnostic

### Binary Data
* Computers are built with transistors (billions of these) that are switches (either on/off)
* Fundamentally, everything our computer does is the result of switches
* Our computer thinks about everything as either on (current - 1) or off (no current - 0)
    * Engineers have worked hard to ensure that there is no transition period
* Bits are the alphabet of computers (to represent 0s and 1s)
