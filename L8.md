# Lecture 8 - IP Addresses 

## Wikipedia
* The information for wikipedia comes from sources around the web - everybody can create an account and edit articles
    * There are wikipedians that police changes and edits
* See Exxon: unfactual claims
* When we are editing Wikipedia: our IP address can be seen
    * The identifier on the packet we are sending is our IP

## IP Addresses
* We need to discuss IP Addresses: The identity of our computer on the internet
    * All computers have an IP address and it is an unique identifier
* We use IPv4 in this class
    * Addresses such as 132.216.177.160
    * Each number is a byte - 256 values to work with
    * There are no IP addresses such as 531.1.1.2 because 531 is too large
    * We eventually run out of IP addresses using IPv4 - this is why we developed to IPv6
* McGill's IP Address is 132.216.177.160
    * The reason why a website has an IP address is that the website is living inside a particular computer (in this case a server)
* Note: everything we are making publically available is technically hosted on another computer/server
* Typically, IP addresses are assigned to avoid duplicates
    * Addresses can change however just like we can physically change locations and live under different addresses
    * Whenever we change networks, our address changes
* The IP address we are assigned is based on the endpoint we are connecting to

## DNS
* Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Yellow Pages for computers
    * Mapping between addresses and names
* It is the combination of IP addresses and DNS that when given an address we can figure out its identity
