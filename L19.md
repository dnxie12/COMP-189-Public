# Lecture 19 - Storing Data Online

* For example, Facebook is a *platform*, not a *type of data*
    
## Types of Data
* **Web** content: HTML (usually stored as a template, shell for all users), CSS
    * The specifics of a webpage such as specific **profile pictures** need to be stored somewhere too
* Login credentials/Account details
* User metadata (data of data)
    * Preferences, settings, etc.
    * User activity (remember the comments one "likes")
    * Things like Facebook friends
* Ads
* Posts, comments, imagegs, texts, geolocation
* Account balances for services such as banks
    * Transaction history

## Data Interaction
* There are 4 common activities done with online data:
    1. Store new
    2. Modify existing
    3. Deleting existing
    4. Searching for existing
* All 4 operations need to handle concurrent access
    * Data needs to be accessible to multiple users accessing data at the same time
    * The level of concurrency in servers is much higher than in our computers locally

## Data Storage and Access
* Hard disks: a large brick, same internal technology as a record player
    * Called hard because unlike floppy disks, they cannot be bent
    * There are magnets inside such disks
        * Stores information using magnets and an arm that swings to the right place to start reading information
    * We use solid state drives nowadays (unlike hard disks, nothing is spinning)
        * Instead use a matrix of wires
* Access time and latency
    * Latency is the amount of time required to do the operation that we want to do
    * When asking a hard disk to grab a file, it takes a certain amount of time for the hard disk's arm to swing over to the right place
    * The computer is reading all over the disk
* Usually we store in an array-based indexing
    * We usually store files contiguously
    * A major problem this introduces: what if we are editing an already stored file?
        * We do not usually "shift" everything in the hard disk that comes after an edit in order to keep contiguousness - this is the worst option because we are potentially moving every file in our hard drive (option 1)
        * We could decide to just rewrite an entire block at the end of a block in order to maintain contiguity but this leaves holes in our hard drive (option 2)

### Fragmentation and Defragmentation
* Usually we *fragment* the file by appending newly edited information at different places in a disk (option 3)
    * This means that we must remember/have special instructions on *how* to read a file (i.e. where the different *fragments* of the file reside and their specific order)
    * This can however leave the hard drive as a mess over time
    * This is why in the early days of computers, machines would get slower and slower and slower because of fragmentation
        * We could manually run de-fragmentation software to "renovate" our hard drive
    * Nowadays, defragmentation is happening on our computers all the time
        * Sometimes, the slow downs we experience come from our computer "cleaning up" part of our hard drive
        * Cost: the more we use and store data, the more fragmentation we create   
        * Defragmentation more efficiently uses space and generally speeds up our computer
    * Defragmentation is a huge pain for servers

### File-Based Storage
* In file-based storage we usually work with **directories** (i.e. folders) and **files**
* A filesystem is often called  a directory tree
* There are different approaches to storing user data/files as directory
    * Especially when we make our structure search-efficient
    * There does not seem to be an optimal format to store everything for every possible type of search
    * Ex: Google has to index the almost entire static internet - there is no way it would store everything in different directories and search them at every search
