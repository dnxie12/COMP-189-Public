# Lecture 16 - NATting Continued

* NATting can be done through and with the purpose of either
    1. A NAT Router (Public IP vs private IP)
        * Allows us to plug multiple private IP addresses on 1 central public IP address
    2. VPN
        * Allows to pretend we are somewhere else than we actually are
            * Accessing content that is restricted to specific IP addresses
        * Protects privacy
    3. Tor networks: Really hide our IP address
        * Situations where one really needs to hide what they are doing from an authoritarian regime
        * One is a whistleblower

## Tor
* The most powerful way of masking IP address
* Core idea: Solve the VPN problem that the latter only constitutes 1 hop/disconnect between the IP and the server
    * The government could quite easily access the original IP back by talking to the VPN provider
    * Tor wants to make it so that it is impossible to tell/trace back the original IP 
    * Idea: randomize/anonymize delivery of information through a node network through which the information passes through first
        * Each person in a hop is a Tor node
        * As long as no Tor node is compromised, the users stay safe
        * Because each node only stores the information about the origin and the destination of a packet, there is no way to distinguish which node is the author of the packet
    * The network arbitrarily (randomly) chooses the route a packet takes
    * The packets are encrypted
    * Tor does not run on specific ports
* The FBI has tried to run Tor nodes to decipher traffic
    * In a hypothetical case where the FBI runs every node except 2, they could be able to find the author of a packet
