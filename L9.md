# Lecture 9 - IP Continued

* Key point: domain names themselves are not part of packets
    * DNS take care of translation from IP addresses
* Packets have an origin IP on them to help obtain a response
    * In the vast majority of communication cases, users want an acknowledgement of receipt (ACK)

## Wikipedia Case
* When there is a change, Wikipedia stores 
    1. The page
    2. The IP Address
    3. The edit message
* Wikipedia wants to avoid bots spamming by:
    1. Keeping prior versions as back-up
        * But mass restoring may not be work because there are many non-vicious edits happening at the same time
    2. Removing edits made by a specific IP address/ban that IP address
* Issue for organizations:
    * Since all IP are visible, it is possible to detect *who* owns the IP of a particular edit
    * WikiScanner checks the list of IP addresses and determines who/where the address comes from
* This is why the website stores IP of edits

## IP Tracking
* On the internet, to see who sends what we could:
    1. Intercept packets and check origin IP address
        * This step would tell us for example that the perpetrator is using Rogers as ISP (or technically possible: that Rogers employees are perpetrating inside Rogers' office)
    2. Go to Rogers and have them look at who the IP address belongs to
        * Since Rogers is an ISP, it might be possible that a country passes laws which forbids ISP of providing that information to law enforcement
        * In most countries, however, governments want ISP to provide such information
* Facebook tries to protect account security through IP
    * Wheen we travel, our IP changes and Facebook's protocol will detect a change in country
        * Used to ask security questions when there is a doubt of compromise
* Key point: IP Addresses cannot be eliminated

## File Sharing
* P2P file sharing
    * Ways of sharing content
* In P2P networks, any computer could say that they have a certain file
    * The RAA could however track people using P2P networks
    * It would pretend to share/download song and then store IP address of source/downloader
        * Would then come to give cease & desist letters to pirates
* **Q:** How do they track if our IP address is changing?
    * **A:** Using the MAC address - explicit and unique identifier of our machine (possible solution)
    * **A:** McGill knows who/when it assigned IP addresses (a sort of history)
        * Note that for McGill we need to login into the network
        * Makes it a lot easier to associate IP Address with identity
* For restaurants/airports with free wi-fi, it is harder to track who uses what and when
    * Police and governments may not be super happy about this
    * Possible solution: require log-in to use public wifi
        * Some airports require you to enter ticket number
* To track somebody down in a public area
    * Most efficient: using CCTV camera
